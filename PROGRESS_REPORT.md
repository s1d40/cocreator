### Completed Work

We have successfully implemented all the planned features for a robust, multimedia-enabled chat application.

**Phase 0: Foundational Chat Interface**
- **[COMPLETED]** A Next.js API route (`/api/chat`) was created to act as a secure proxy to the backend ADK `api_server`.
- **[COMPLETED]** A new chat UI was built that connects to the proxy via Server-Sent Events (SSE) to display the agent's streaming responses in real-time.

**Phase 1: File Uploads**
- **[COMPLETED]** The project's Terraform configuration was updated to automatically provision a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket for file uploads.
- **[COMPLETED]** A secure API endpoint (`/api/generate-upload-url`) was created to generate temporary signed URLs for direct-to-GCS uploads.
- **[COMPLETED]** A drag-and-drop `FileUploader` component was built and integrated into the chat interface.
- **[COMPLETED]** The end-to-end file upload flow is now functional. The GCS URI of an uploaded file is automatically appended to the user's message.

**Phase 2: Multimedia Display**
- **[COMPLETED]** A `ResultsView` component was created to render different media types (images, audio, video).
- **[COMPLETED]** The chat page now automatically detects media links in agent responses and displays them using the `ResultsView`.
- **[COMPLETED]** A download button for all generated assets is included.
- **[COMPLETED]** The backend `reporting_agent` has been updated to construct and return public GCS URLs for all generated media.

**Session and Log Management**
- **[COMPLETED]** Session persistence has been implemented using `localStorage` to maintain the conversation across page reloads.
- **[COMPLETED]** A client-side logging utility has been created and integrated to provide better debugging information.

### Next Steps

All primary implementation phases are complete. The final optional phase involves performance optimization for long-running tasks.

**Phase 3: Asynchronous Processing (Optional)**
- **[PENDING]** For long-running tasks, investigate and implement a task queue (e.g., Google Cloud Tasks) and a corresponding Cloud Function to handle processing asynchronously.
