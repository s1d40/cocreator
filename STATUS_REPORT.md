# Software Status Report

## Project Overview

The project is an "AI Content Engine" designed to automate the entire content creation pipeline. It takes a topic or a source URL and generates a complete multimedia package, which includes a full article, a synchronized video, and a set of downloadable assets.

## Current Status

### Frontend

*   **Framework:** Next.js
*   **Status:** The frontend application is fully functional and running locally on `http://localhost:3000`. The user interface allows users to interact with the content generation pipeline.
*   **Deployment:** The frontend is ready for deployment.

### Backend

*   **Framework:** Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
*   **Architecture:** The backend is a multi-agent system orchestrated by a central `CoordinatorAgent`. This agent manages a pipeline of specialized agents, each responsible for a specific task in the content creation process.
*   **Agents:**
    *   `planning_agent`: Analyzes the input topic/URL and generates a structured content outline.
    *   `writer_agent`: Takes the content outline and writes a full, high-quality article.
    *   `multimedia_producer_agent`: Generates a set of 8-12 thematically synchronized images and audio voiceovers for the article. It also creates social media posts.
    *   `video_producer_agent`: Combines the generated images and audio into a 6-8 minute synchronized video.
    *   `reporting_agent`: Creates a final report that includes the article, video, individual image files, image prompts, and the full audio transcript.
*   **Status:** The backend is fully implemented and functional. The agent pipeline is robust and can successfully generate all the specified multimedia assets.

## Summary

The AI Content Engine is in a fully functional state. The frontend is running locally and is ready for deployment. The backend multi-agent system is complete and capable of generating the entire multimedia package as designed. The immediate next step should be to deploy the frontend application to a public-facing web server to resolve the issue with the Google for Startups Cloud Program application.
