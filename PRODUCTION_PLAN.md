# Cocreator Application: Production and Monetization Plan

This document outlines the strategy and steps required to take the Cocreator application from its current prototype stage to a production-ready, monetized service.

### 1. Overview

The primary goal is to launch the Cocreator Studio as a beta product, secured by a robust authentication system and integrated with a payment gateway to handle user subscriptions. This plan leverages our existing technology stack—Firebase Hosting for the frontend and Google Cloud Run for the backend—to ensure a scalable and maintainable architecture.

### 2. Authentication Strategy

A secure and user-friendly authentication system is the foundation of a production application.

*   **Technology:** **Firebase Authentication** will be used. It is the natural choice given our stack, offering seamless integration, a variety of authentication providers (Google, Email/Password, etc.), and excellent security features.

*   **User Authentication Flow:**
    1.  **Frontend:** The user will sign up or log in via the frontend application. We will use the Firebase UI library or build a custom interface that uses the Firebase Auth SDK.
    2.  **JWT Token:** Upon successful login, the Firebase Auth SDK will provide the frontend with a JSON Web Token (JWT).
    3.  **Authenticated Requests:** The frontend will include this JWT in the `Authorization` header for all API requests to the Cloud Run backend (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).

*   **Backend Verification:**
    1.  **Middleware:** The Cloud Run backend will be updated with a middleware to protect our API endpoints.
    2.  **Token Validation:** This middleware will use the Firebase Admin SDK to verify the JWT on every incoming request. It will check the token's signature and expiration.
    3.  **User Identification:** Upon successful verification, the middleware will extract the user's unique ID (`uid`) from the token. This `uid` will be used to identify the user for all subsequent operations, replacing the hardcoded `"test_user"`.

### 3. Monetization Strategy

We will implement a tiered subscription model to monetize the application.

*   **Pricing Model:** We will offer several subscription tiers (e.g., Free, Pro, Business). Each tier will have different limits on features, such as the number of videos that can be created per month, access to premium voiceovers, or higher-resolution video output.

*   **Payment Gateway:** **Stripe** will be used for payment processing. It is the industry standard and offers excellent developer tools, documentation, and integration with Firebase.

*   **Subscription and Payment Flow:**
    1.  **User Selects Plan:** The user chooses a subscription plan on our pricing page.
    2.  **Stripe Checkout:** The user is redirected to a secure, pre-built Stripe Checkout page to enter their payment information.
    3.  **Webhook Confirmation:** After a successful payment, Stripe will send a webhook event to a dedicated, secure endpoint on our Cloud Run backend.
    4.  **Backend Handler:** This endpoint will have a handler that:
        *   Verifies the webhook's signature to ensure it originated from Stripe.
        *   Updates the user's subscription status in our database (Firestore). This will involve creating a customer profile in Stripe and linking the Stripe Customer ID to the user's Firebase Auth `uid`.

### 4. Backend and Database Architecture

To support authentication and subscriptions, our backend and database need to be updated.

*   **Database:** **Firestore** will be used as our primary database.
    *   **`users` Collection:** A new collection will be created where the document ID for each user is their Firebase Auth `uid`. This document will store:
        *   The user's email address.
        *   Their Stripe Customer ID.
        *   Their current subscription tier (e.g., "Pro").
        *   Usage metrics (e.g., `videos_created_this_month`).
    *   **`sessions` Collection:** The existing collection for session data will be updated to include the user's `uid` to associate each session with a specific user.

*   **Cloud Run Service:**
    *   The backend will be updated to handle the new authentication middleware and the Stripe webhook endpoint.
    *   All business logic will be modified to read the user's `uid` from the authenticated request and check their subscription status and usage limits before performing any actions.

### 5. Release Plan

We will follow a phased approach to release, starting with a beta.

*   **Phase 1: Beta Launch**
    *   **Goal:** Gather user feedback, identify bugs, and validate the core value proposition.
    *   **Access:** The Cocreator Studio will be launched as a "closed beta," accessible by invitation only, or an "open beta" for early adopters.
    *   **Payments:** Stripe will be configured in "test mode," allowing us to test the entire subscription and payment flow without processing real financial transactions.
    *   **Feedback Mechanism:** We will implement a simple way for beta users to provide feedback directly within the application.

*   **Phase 2: Public Launch**
    *   **Goal:** A stable, monetized public release.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Incorporate feedback from the beta phase.
        *   Switch Stripe to "live mode" to begin accepting real payments.
        *   Implement a marketing and user acquisition strategy.
        *   Provide clear documentation and user support channels.

### 6. Next Steps Checklist

1.  **Frontend:**
    *   [ ] Integrate Firebase Authentication for user signup and login.
    *   [ ] Implement the UI for the pricing page.
    *   [ ] Create the logic to redirect users to Stripe Checkout.
    *   [ ] Update API requests to include the JWT in the `Authorization` header.

2.  **Backend:**
    *   [ ] Add a middleware to the Cloud Run service to verify Firebase JWTs.
    *   [ ] Create the Stripe webhook endpoint to handle subscription events.
    *   [ ] Update all relevant business logic to be user-aware (using `uid`) and to check subscription status.

3.  **Database:**
    *   [ ] Define and implement the Firestore data model for the `users` collection.
    *   [ ] Update the `sessions` collection to include a `uid`.

4.  **Infrastructure:**
    *   [ ] Set up separate Firebase and GCP projects for development, staging, and production.
    *   [ ] Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
    *   [ ] Configure Stripe with our product and pricing information (in both test and live modes).
